Idea-
Send a link to all the registered candidates about the voting venue, date and time. They will also be notified about the candidates standing from their constituency and their Election Affidavit will be there for the public to see along with their name. Another link will be sent to the voters which will ask for feedback on the poling process and also they can be asked about whome they voted for. This will not only help collect feedback, but it will make voting turnout estimation process short and also serve as a good exit-poll.
